At some point in your journey to become a full-stack web developer, youâ€™ll likely be asked to complete a coding assessment&mdash;perhaps as part of an interview process. A typical coding assessment includes both multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges. 

## Introduction
During our journey to becoming a full-stack web developer, there will come instances where we will be asked to partake in coding assessments. To prepare for this, a quiz application is needed to test fundamental Javascript knowledge. 

## Technologies
This quiz application was built using HTML, CSS and Javascript. This application primarily relies on Javascript to: 
<br>
1) Begin the quiz, 
<br>
2) Provide questions and multiple-choice answers, 
<br>
3) Collect user data to determine whether the answers are correct, 
<br>
4) Keep score and appends a final "highscore" page from quiz results. 
<br>

## Deliverables
A working quiz application to aid users in testing fundamental Javascript knowledge. 
- Start Quiz button initiates quiz timer and first quiz question
- Answering a question will display a popup indicating whether answer is correct or incorrect, and proceeds to the next question
- Selecting a correct answer will add points to a score (will be displayed at the end)
- Selecting an incorrect answer reduces time on countdown
- Once all questions are answered/time runs out, quiz will be over and the final score displayed 
- User will be able to to input their name to save their score to local storage
- List of highscores will be available at the final screen
- Options to clear highscores and replay quiz are available

## Installation
To install this application, please download the zip file, or alternatively clone the repository through GitHub's guidelines.
